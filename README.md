## Overview

Tempus is a Python-based bot designed to streamline work hour tracking. It offers a simple one-click system to start
time tracking, minimizing interface complexity. If users forget to track time, Tempus sends reminders or allows for
manual time entry. At the end of the work month, it generates comprehensive reports covering salary, bonuses, and
overtime. Customizable to specific enterprise needs, future updates aim to include access control and detailed manager
statistics.
